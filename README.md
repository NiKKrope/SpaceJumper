This is my Project for the DALI AR/VR application

Here are some notes about the game:
The Build for it can be found in the "Builds" Folder

Here is a quick rundown of the game:
1. You are an astronaut in space and you have to get to the end of the level by using your gravity grenates, which push you away from them
2. WASD (or Arrow Keys) to move , Space to Jump
3. Mouse1 to Shoot your Gravity Grenade
4. Move Mouse to Look Around
5. Your goal is to get to the yellow star at the end of the level

Things that are not entirely finished yet:
1. The movement. I made the mistake of using a simple character controller as my method of moving around the player, instead of a RigidBody, so that made the idea of pushing the player harder then it should have been, which also made it not as smooth as I wouldn't hoped.
3. The shooting of the Gravity Grenade, it's kind of wonky and doesn't really shoot directly from your camera

Things I did not yet have time to implement:
Respawning (idk how I forgot this one, but it's a btu too late now, just restart the game if you fall off :)
